Master event-driven microservices architecture with patterns using Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Kafka, and Elasticsearch

## The microservices patterns that you will be implementing are:

- Externalized configuration with Spring Cloud Config
- CQRS with Kafka and Elasticsearch
- API versioning for versioning of REST APIs
- Service Registration and Discovery with Spring Cloud and Netflix Eureka
- API Gateway with Spring Cloud Gateway
- Circuit breaker with Spring Cloud Gateway and Resilience4j
- Rate limiting with Spring Cloud Gateway and Redis to use Redis as the Rate limiter
- Distributed tracing with SLF4J MDC, Spring Cloud Sleuth, and Zipkin
- Log aggregation with ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana)
- Client-side load balancing with Spring Cloud Load Balancer
- Database per Service
- Messaging between microservices using Kafka
